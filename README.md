## Football leagues REST api

### This is a Symfony Engineer Offsite Development Task
#### Notes:
1) JWT authorisation implementation is primitive. With additional time efforts it can be extended with refresh token.
2) Test implemented in a primitive way as well (1 test with HTTP response for 1 endpoint). No negative testing.
3) Migrations generated from entities - `php bin/console make:migration`
4) DB generated from migrations - `php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`
5) Data can be generated from fixtures (and used for tests) - `php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load`
